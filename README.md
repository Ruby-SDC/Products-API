#Products API (System Design Capstone) 

A back-end system that supports the frontend of Urban Octo Chainsaw Clothing (Catwalk).
The purpose of this repository is to replace the already existing API that came with the creation of Catwalk with a larger, more robust API that can support the full data set of the project and can scale to meet the demands of production traffic. Each member of our team was responsible for one service of the catwalk application:
